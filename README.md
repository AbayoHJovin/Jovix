This is the frontend ecommerce application which I managed to make using reactjs. I styled it using tailwindcss. Some of the data I used like images, are from dummyjson api. When you run it, you will find something amazing from it.

# How to run Jovix
 first make sure that you are in folder which contains the frontend application, type (npm i) to install the packages which you have not installed from npm.

 After that, run (npm run dev) command to start the frontend server. open it in your browser and feel free to use it.
